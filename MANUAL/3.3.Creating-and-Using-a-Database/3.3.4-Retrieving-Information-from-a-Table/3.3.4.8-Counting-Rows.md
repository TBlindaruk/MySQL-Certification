### 3.3.4.8 Counting Rows

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/counting-rows.html

<p>
If you name columns to select in addition to the COUNT() value, a GROUP BY clause should be present that names those same columns. Otherwise, the following occurs:
</p>

```SQL
mysql> SET sql_mode = 'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT owner, COUNT(*) FROM pet;
ERROR 1140 (42000): Mixing of GROUP columns (MIN(),MAX(),COUNT()...)
with no GROUP columns is illegal if there is no GROUP BY clause
```

<p>
If ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY is not enabled, the query is processed by treating all rows as a single group, but the value selected for each named column is indeterminate. The server is free to select the value from any row:
</p>

```SQL
mysql> SET sql_mode = '';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT owner, COUNT(*) FROM pet;
+--------+----------+
| owner  | COUNT(*) |
+--------+----------+
| Harold |        8 |
+--------+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
