### 3.4 Getting Information About Databases and Tables

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/getting-information.html

<p>
You have previously seen SHOW DATABASES, which lists the databases managed by the server. To find out which database is currently selected, use the DATABASE() function
</p>

```SQL
SELECT DATABASE();
```

| DATABASE() |
|------------|
| mysql_manual|

<strong>If you have not yet selected any database, the result is NULL.</strong>

-------------
<p>
To find out what tables the default database contains (for example, when you are not sure about the name of a table), use this statement:
</p>

```SQL
SHOW TABLES;
```

| Tables_in_mysql_manual |
|---------------------|
| event               |
| pet                 |

-------------

<p>
If you want to find out about the structure of a table, the DESCRIBE statement is useful; it displays information about each of a table's columns:
</p>

```SQL
DESCRIBE pet;
```

| Field   | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
|---------|-------------|------|-----|---------|-------|
| name    | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| owner   | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| species | varchar(20) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| sex     | char(1)     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| birth   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| death   | date        | YES  |     | NULL    |       |

<strong>DESC is a short form of DESCRIBE.</strong>
