#### The Range Access Method for Single-Part Indexes

<p>The definition of a range condition for a single-part index is as follows:</p>

- For both `BTREE` and `HASH` indexes, comparison of a key part with a constant value is a range condition when using the `=`, `<=>`, `IN()`, `IS NULL`, or `IS NOT NULL` operators.
- Additionally, for `BTREE` indexes, comparison of a key part with a constant value is a range condition when using the `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `BETWEEN`, `!=`, or `<>` operators, or LIKE comparisons if the argument to `LIKE is a constant string that does not start with a wildcard character`.
- For all index types, multiple range conditions combined with OR or AND form a range condition.

<p>“Constant value” in the preceding descriptions means one of the following:</p>

- A constant from the query string
- A column of a `const` or `system` table from the same join
- The result of an uncorrelated subquery
- Any expression composed entirely from subexpressions of the preceding types

Here are some examples of queries with range conditions in the WHERE clause:
```SQL
SELECT * FROM t1
  WHERE key_col > 1
  AND key_col < 10;

SELECT * FROM t1
  WHERE key_col = 1
  OR key_col IN (15,18,20);

SELECT * FROM t1
  WHERE key_col LIKE 'ab%'
  OR key_col BETWEEN 'bar' AND 'foo';
```
