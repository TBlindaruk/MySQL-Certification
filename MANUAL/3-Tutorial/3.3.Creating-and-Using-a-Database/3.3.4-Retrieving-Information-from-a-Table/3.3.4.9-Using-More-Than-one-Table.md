### 3.3.4.9 Using More Than one Table

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/multiple-tables.html

```SQL
CREATE TABLE event (
  name   VARCHAR(20),
  date   DATE,
  type   VARCHAR(15),
  remark VARCHAR(255)
);
```

`event.txt`

|name|	date|	type|	remark|
|---|------|----|-----|
|Fluffy|	1995-05-15|	litter|	4 kittens, 3 female, 1 male|
|Buffy|	1993-06-23|	litter|	5 puppies, 2 female, 3 male|
|Buffy|	1994-06-19|	litter|	3 puppies, 3 female|
|Chirpy	|1999-03-21|	vet|	needed beak straightened|
|Slim|	1997-08-03|	vet|	broken rib|
|Bowser|	1991-10-12|	kennel	 | |
|Fang|	1991-10-12|	kennel	| 
|Fang|	1998-08-28|	birthday	|Gave him a new chew toy|
|Claws|	1998-03-17	|birthday	|Gave him a new flea collar|
|Whistler	|1998-12-09	|birthday	|First birthday|

<strong>Load the records like this:</strong>

```SQL
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'event.txt' INTO TABLE event;
```

<p>
Suppose that you want to find out the ages at which each pet had its litters. We saw earlier how to calculate ages from two dates. The litter date of the mother is in the event table, but to calculate her age on that date you need her birth date, which is stored in the pet table. This means the query requires both tables:
</p>

```SQL
SELECT
  pet.name,
  TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, birth, DATE) AS age,
  remark
FROM pet
  INNER JOIN event
    ON pet.name = event.name
WHERE event.type = 'litter';
```

| name   | age  | remark                      |
|--------|------|-----------------------------|
| Fluffy |    2 | 4 kittens, 3 female, 1 male |
| Buffy  |    4 | 5 puppies, 2 female, 3 male |
| Buffy  |    5 | 3 puppies, 3 female         |

-----------------

<p>
You need not have two different tables to perform a join. Sometimes it is useful to join a table to itself, if you want to compare records in a table to other records in that same table. For example, to find breeding pairs among your pets, you can join the pet table with itself to produce candidate pairs of males and females of like species:
</p>

```SQL
SELECT
  p1.name,
  p1.sex,
  p2.name,
  p2.sex,
  p1.species
FROM pet AS p1
  INNER JOIN pet AS p2
    ON p1.species = p2.species
       AND p1.sex = 'm'
       AND p2.sex = 'f';
```

| name   | sex  | name   | sex  | species |
|--------|------|--------|------|---------|
| Fluffy | f    | Claws  | m    | cat     |
| Buffy  | f    | Fang   | m    | dog     |
| Buffy  | f    | Bowser | m    | dog     |
