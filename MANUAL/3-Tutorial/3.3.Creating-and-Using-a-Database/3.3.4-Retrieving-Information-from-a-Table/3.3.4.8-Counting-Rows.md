### 3.3.4.8 Counting Rows

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/counting-rows.html

<p>
If you name columns to select in addition to the COUNT() value, a GROUP BY clause should be present that names those same columns. Otherwise, the following occurs:
</p>

```SQL
mysql> SET sql_mode = 'ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT owner, COUNT(*) FROM pet;
ERROR 1140 (42000): Mixing of GROUP columns (MIN(),MAX(),COUNT()...)
with no GROUP columns is illegal if there is no GROUP BY clause
```

<p>
If ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY is not enabled, the query is processed by treating all rows as a single group, but the value selected for each named column is indeterminate. The server is free to select the value from any row:
</p>

```SQL
mysql> SET sql_mode = '';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT owner, COUNT(*) FROM pet;
+--------+----------+
| owner  | COUNT(*) |
+--------+----------+
| Harold |        8 |
+--------+----------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

---------------------

<strong>
COUNT doesn't count NULL values, so if you are counting values by a field that has NULL values, that rows won't be counted by COUNT.
</strong>

<p>
Example: I have the same table pet with two fields, owner and species and I have inserted one row with owner=NULL. The table has 6 rows, 2 dogs, 2 cats and 2 birds ;)
</p>

```SQL
SELECT species, COUNT(*) FROM pet GROUP BY species;
```

| species | COUNT(*) |
|---------|----------|
| bird    |        2 |
| cat     |        2 |
| dog     |        2 |

--------------

```SQL
SELECT species, COUNT(owner) FROM pet GROUP BY species;
```

| species | COUNT(owner) |
|---------|--------------|
| bird    |            2 |
| cat     |            2 |
| dog     |            1 |

--------------

```SQL
select * from pet;
```

| owner  | species |
|--------|---------|
| Benny  | bird    |
| Diane  | bird    |
| Gwen   | cat     |
| Harold | cat     |
| Adrian | dog     |
| NULL   | dog     |
