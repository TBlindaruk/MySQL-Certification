### 3.6.4 The Rows Holding the Group-wise Maximum of a Certain Column

<p><i>Task: For each article, find the dealer or dealers with the most expensive price.</i></p>

<strong>This problem can be solved with a subquery like this one:</strong>

```SQL
SELECT article, dealer, price
FROM   shop s1
WHERE  price=(SELECT MAX(s2.price)
              FROM shop s2
              WHERE s1.article = s2.article);
```

| article | dealer | price |
|---------|--------|-------|
|    0001 | B      |  3.99 |
|    0002 | A      | 10.99 |
|    0003 | C      |  1.69 |
|    0004 | D      | 19.95 |

<p>
The preceding example uses a correlated subquery, which can be inefficient (see Section 13.2.10.7, “Correlated Subqueries”). 
</p>

---------------------

<strong>Uncorrelated subquery:</strong>

```SQL
SELECT
  s1.article,
  dealer,
  s1.price
FROM shop s1
  JOIN (
         SELECT
           article,
           MAX(price) AS price
         FROM shop
         GROUP BY article) AS s2
    ON s1.article = s2.article AND s1.price = s2.price;
```

-----------------------

<strong>LEFT JOIN:</strong>

```SQL
SELECT
  s1.article,
  s1.dealer,
  s1.price
FROM shop s1
  LEFT JOIN shop s2
    ON s1.article = s2.article
       AND s1.price < s2.price
WHERE s2.article IS NULL;
```

<i>The LEFT JOIN works on the basis that when s1.price is at its maximum value, there is no s2.price with a greater value and the s2 rows values will be NULL.</i>
