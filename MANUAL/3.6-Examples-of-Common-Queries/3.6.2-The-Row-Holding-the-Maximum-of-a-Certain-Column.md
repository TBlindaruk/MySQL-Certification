### 3.6.2 The Row Holding the Maximum of a Certain Column

<p><i>Task: Find the number, dealer, and price of the most expensive article.</i></p>

<strong>This is easily done with a subquery:</strong>

```SQL
SELECT article, dealer, price
FROM   shop
WHERE  price=(SELECT MAX(price) FROM shop);
```

| article | dealer | price |
|---------|--------|-------|
|    0004 | D      | 19.95 |

-------------------------------------

<p>Other solutions are to use a LEFT JOIN </p>

```SQL
SELECT s1.article, s1.dealer, s1.price
FROM shop s1
LEFT JOIN shop s2 ON s1.price < s2.price
WHERE s2.article IS NULL;
```

<p>
sort all rows descending by price and get only the first row using the MySQL-specific LIMIT clause:
</p>

```SQL
SELECT article, dealer, price
FROM shop
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
